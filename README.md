## Installation
The following dependencies were installed to run the application. 
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

## Steps to Install
If you wish to run it locally, you can follow these instructions:

#### Step 1

Install MongoDB:
Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your machine. Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB locally.

#### Step 2

Download or Clone this repo:
You can either download the repo as a zip file and unzip it to your computer, or you can clone it down to your computer directly.

#### Step 3

Navigate to App Directory:
Make sure you are in the directory of the application. It should be in a folder named social-media-mongodb. 

#### Step 4

Install Dependencies:
If there's no package.json file, enter `'npm init'` to download it. If there's already a package.json file, in the terminal, enter `'npm install'`. This should cause the application to find and install all necessary dependencies. Express and mongoose will the two dependencies needed to run this application. 

#### Step 5

Start the application:
In the command line, enter `'npm run start'`. As long as there are no errors, this should start the server and run it at http://localhost:3001

## Usage

#### Step 1

Run the application:
As mentioned in the installation section, install and run the application.

#### Step 2

First time access to Insomnia:
To send requests to the correct routes, it is recommended to install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download). It can be downloaded on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

#### Step 3

Insomnia features:
Under DEBUG, there are CRUD functions to choose from. The most common functions are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Let's first start with GET and type in `localhost:3001`. This should display data. Depending on the route you'd like to check, you can pull response data of one request and feed it into the next request.
